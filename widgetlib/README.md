## Examples

Subfolders contain main parts of working examples from demo prototype. The rest of scripting (usually 
event scripts are very small one liners). Examine demo and copy / paste them directly from Axure.

Every script here is in two versions:

1. Big, annotated (with lots of comments)
2. Minified. I use uglifyjs to minify javascript files. They're load and perform faster with less  
   resource consumption
